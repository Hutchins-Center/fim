[["index.html", "Economics Methodology 1 Welcome!", " Economics Methodology Lorae Stojanovic 2024-06-22 1 Welcome! The purpose of this document is to explain, in depth, how the FIM works. It is intended to encapsulate the technical elements of the project arising from the programming design as well as the economic design. Chapter 1 documents the sources of data. Chapter 2 documents how the FIM is calculated. Chapter 3 documents how the UI interface is constructed. Chapter 4 describes the economic intuition for the FIM.

We draw from BEA, CBO, haver, etc. But we will need a flow chart of all the scripts, all the dependencies, and explain why each source is used for each item. When do we overwrite history? We’ll probably have one sub section for each source, like: 2.1.1 CBO stuff here. Which reports do we use? Budget? Economic? How do we input their data into the FIM? 2.1.2 BEA Same questions as above 2.1.3 Haver Discuss Haver package, etc. 2.2 Combining &amp; wrangling I have no idea how this is done, and we will have to refactor this section in depth. 2.3 The clean data We use the “projections” data frame (at least for now) in the remainder of the code. In its current refactored state in the fiscal_impact_BETA script, we select columns of interest from the lonnngggg “projections” data frame and use those as we calculate the FIM. "],["data-processing.html", "3 Data Processing 3.1 Input data 3.2 The equations that actually fovern the FIM", " 3 Data Processing 3.1 Input data The FIM has many inputs. But when we run the FIM, we typically take into account 23 main data series, which are found in the “forecast” section of the sheet. “An image of the ‘forecast’ page of the ‘forecast.xlsx’ workbook.” 3.2 The equations that actually fovern the FIM Your best source for data processing steps as they stand (in late June 2024) is to look at docs/variables_tracker. It maps out how each input leads to each output and what operations are done along the way. I’m using it to completely refactor the computation section of the FIM. We’ll have to write up this section later. 3.2.1 MPC subsection There’s a lot of cool documentation about how we calculate MPCs using matrices in the src/mpc_lorae.R file. Please refer to that to write about how the economic concept of MPCs translates into code. 3.2.2 minus neutral subsection I’m sure we’ll have stuff about our reasoning here 3.2.3 other stuff section more content "],["ui-presentation.html", "4 UI Presentation", " 4 UI Presentation This chapter will focus on how the results are presented in a user-friendly UI. We will use various R packages such as shiny to create interactive dashboards.
