The Hutchins Center Fiscal Impact Measure shows how much local, state,
and federal tax and spending policy adds to or subtracts from overall
economic growth, and provides a near-term forecast of fiscal policiesâ€™
effects on economic activity.

to see the most recent version of the FIM.

This repository contains the code used to calculate the FIM. It was originally authored by Manuel Alcala Kovalski and currently mantained by Nasiha Salwati. 


## Installation

The FIM project is structured as an R package in order to easily load functions, data, and documentation. To understand the directory structure and conventions used throughout the projects and for an introduction to R packages take a look at the [Brookings Data Network Brownbag presentation on R packages](https://malcalakovalski.github.io/rpkgs/#1). For a deeper dive read Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's book on [R packages](https://r-pkgs.org). 

In order to run the FIM code you first need to install the FIM package by running 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools") (install devtools if you don't have it already)
devtools::install_github("Hutchins-Center/fim")
```

Once you finish installing it, you can clone this repository and run the code. 

## Instructions

### Updating BEA data

The BEA releases their GDP estimates and revisions on a monthly basis. We pull these BEA updates from Haver by running the `data-raw/pre-process.R` script. That script saves the BEA data to analyze in the `data` folder. 

## Calculating the FIM

In order to run the FIM calculations with the updated data run the `fiscal-impact.R` script found in the parent directory. This scripts merges the BEA data with our forecast, calculates the fiscal impact for purchases, taxes, and transfers at the federal and state level, and creates a parametrized RMarkdown report to compare results between one update to the next. 

All the relevant outputs of `fiscal-impact.R` can be found in the `results/{current-month}` folder, inclduing the RMarkdown update comparison report. A copy of this report is moved to the parent directory and renamed index.Rmd in order to share it quickly as a link using Github pages.
