# Data Processing

## Input data

The FIM has many inputs. But when we run the FIM, we typically take into account 23 main data series, which are found in the "forecast" section of the sheet.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create the data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Name = c(
    "Consumption Grants", "Investment Grants", "Federal Purchases (NIPA Consistent)",
    "State Purchases (NIPA Consistent)", "Non-ARP Subsidies + ARP Provider Relief and PPP",
    "ARP Subsidies less Provider Relief and PPP", "Federal UI", "State UI", "Federal Medicaid",
    "Total Medicaid", "Medicare", "Non-ARP Rebate Checks", "ARP Rebate Checks",
    "ARP Other Vulnerable", "ARP Other Direct Aid plus Provider Relief",
    "Other Federal Social Benefits (including all SNAP)", "State Social Benefits ex Medicaid",
    "Federal Non-Corporate Taxes", "State Non-Corporate Taxes", "Federal Corporate Taxes",
    "State Corporate Taxes", "Federal Student Loans", "Supply Side IRA"
  ),
  VariableName = c(
    "consumption_grants", "investment_grants", "federal_purchases",
    "state_purchases", "federal_subsidies", "federal_aid_to_small_businesses_arp",
    "federal_ui", "state_ui", "medicaid_grants", "medicaid", "medicare",
    "rebate_checks", "rebate_checks_arp", "federal_other_vulnerable_arp",
    "federal_other_direct_aid_arp", "federal_social_benefits", "state_social_benefits",
    "federal_non_corporate_taxes", "state_non_corporate_taxes", "federal_corporate_taxes",
    "state_corporate_taxes", "federal_student_loans", "supply_side_ira"
  )
)

# Create the interactive table
datatable(data, colnames = c("Name", "Variable Name"), caption = "FIM Project Variables", options = list(pageLength = 23))
```

## The equations that actually fovern the FIM

Your best source for data processing steps as they stand (in late June 2024) is to look at docs/variables_tracker.

It maps out how each input leads to each output and what operations are done along the way. I'm using it to completely refactor the computation section of the FIM.

We'll have to write up this section later.

### MPC subsection

There's a lot of cool documentation about how we calculate MPCs using matrices in the src/mpc_lorae.R file. Please refer to that to write about how the economic concept of MPCs translates into code.

### minus neutral subsection

I'm sure we'll have stuff about our reasoning here

### other stuff section
