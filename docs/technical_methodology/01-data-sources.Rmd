# Data Sources

## Data sources

We will have to figure this section out. We draw from BEA, CBO, haver, etc. But we will need a flow chart of all the scripts, all the dependencies, and explain why each source is used for each item. When do we overwrite history?

We'll probably have one sub section for each source, like:

### CBO
stuff here. Which reports do we use? Budget? Economic? How do we input their data into the FIM?

### BEA
Same questions as above

### Haver
Discuss Haver package, etc.

## Combining & wrangling

I have no idea how this is done, and we will have to refactor this section in depth. 

## The clean data
We use the "projections" data frame (at least for now) in the remainder of the code. In its current refactored state in the fiscal_impact_BETA script, we select columns of interest from the lonnngggg "projections" data frame and use those as we calculate the FIM.
